# Workflow Dependencies Test

This repository uses GitHub Actions workflows that reference other repositories.

## Workflow Dependencies

This repository demonstrates:
1. **Reusable workflows** - Calling workflows from other repositories
2. **Action dependencies** - Using actions from both local and external repos
3. **Local vs external** - Mix of same-org and public dependencies

## Purpose

Tests:
- GitHub Actions workflow parsing
- Reusable workflow detection
- Action dependency extraction
- Local vs external classification
